# Spinner Rules

## Tiles
66 tiles (Double 9 set with 11 spinners)  
Tile value = No of pips + 10 for each spinner

## Players
2-8 players  
*I suggest 2 as limit*

## Sets(Hands)
Rules specify 10 hands start with 9|9 then 8|8 ... 0|0  
*I suggest we stick with 9|9*

## Rules
- Play starts with:  
    1. Player who has start tile or S|S
    1. Player who shuffled
- Play proceeds to left
- If player doesn't have a valid play, they draw one tile and pass *or draw until they have a play*
- 

## Setup

1. Shuffle boneyard
2. Draw 7 *(or 14)* tiles per player

## Play
1. PLay start tile or S|S, if not in hand, draw until available.
2. Play tile with start value or S|?.
3. Play tile with start value or S|?.
3. Play tile that matched end.
4. If double is played, must play 3 tiles with that value before any other plays
5. If spinner is played spinner takes on value of end to which it is played.
6. Hand ends when one player has empty hand. Score is total value of tiles left in hand 
7. Winner has lowest score
