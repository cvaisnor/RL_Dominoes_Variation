For simplicity, certain rules may not be implemented.

This game is an example of a Partially Oberverable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) as the player does not know the opponents tiles (Similar to Poker).

A little research - There not much iout htere on Spinner but regular Dominoes is mroe popular

Here's an [article](https://medium.com/@axegggl/dominoes-game-with-simple-ai-in-python-df7f62feab4) on creating a Dominoes AI, perhaps this could be a model for our agent to beat?

Here's a [pygame version of dominoes](https://www.pygame.org/project-Dominos-1119-.html) we could use for a template for an interface if we want one.  I downloaded the code and got it working.

Been thinking about state spaces etc, if you look at the article, the played tiles are importnat in forming strategy.
